- Put last "pass" = transfer of last view to the current swap view in renderer.
 - no need for a renderpass, onr a pipeline, I think
 - no more need to pass a render pass to the scene.

- RENAME: 
  - Scene is doing too much rendering. It should not own pipelines.
  - Renderer does almost nothing. It should own:
    - DescriptorPool
    - DescriptorSetLayouts
    - Pipelines
    - FrameBuffers
    - RenderPasses

- many lights = handle array of struct in scene ubo (size?)

- separate build_command_buffer ->(cmd begin, pass begin, ..., pass end, cmd end)
  from     draw -> submit and present.
  build_command_buffer can then be called in //

- draw INSTANCED sur les petits cubes.
