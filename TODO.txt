COMPUTE PARTICLES:
- use two SSBOs
  - one for simulation data: pos, rot, scale, speed, ...
  - one for instance data: matrix, material
  - can help with parallelism:
    - compute shader reads/write from/to first
    - write into second
    - fragment shader read second
    - first one available for reading.

- Add stb image
- Add tiny obj loader
- Add gltf loader?

- Put last "pass" = transfer of last view to the current swap view in renderer.
 - no need for a renderpass, onr a pipeline, I think
 - no more need to pass a render pass to the scene.

- RENAME: 
  - Scene is doing too much rendering. It should not own pipelines.
  - Renderer does almost nothing. It should own:
    - DescriptorPool
    - DescriptorSetLayouts
    - Pipelines
    - FrameBuffers
    - RenderPasses

- separate build_command_buffer ->(cmd begin, pass begin, ..., pass end, cmd end)
  from     draw -> submit and present.
  build_command_buffer can then be called in //
