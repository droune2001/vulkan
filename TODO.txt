COMPUTE PARTICLES:
x STORAGE flag for the vertexbuffer of instanced data.
x compute queue
x compute command buffer pool
x compute command buffer
x add things to the global descriptor pool
- compute descriptor set
- compute descriptor set layout
- compute pipeline layout
- compute pipeline
x compute fences
= compute uniform buffer to drive simulation
  x create uniform buffer
  - fill each frame with time
x record compute command buffer

- Put last "pass" = transfer of last view to the current swap view in renderer.
 - no need for a renderpass, onr a pipeline, I think
 - no more need to pass a render pass to the scene.

- RENAME: 
  - Scene is doing too much rendering. It should not own pipelines.
  - Renderer does almost nothing. It should own:
    - DescriptorPool
    - DescriptorSetLayouts
    - Pipelines
    - FrameBuffers
    - RenderPasses

- separate build_command_buffer ->(cmd begin, pass begin, ..., pass end, cmd end)
  from     draw -> submit and present.
  build_command_buffer can then be called in //
