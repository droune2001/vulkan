- more than one texture = put sampler in object ubo.
- many lights = handle array of struct in scene ubo (size?)
- more objects material params = handle more than model_matrix.

- wrapper classes for objects like buffers, device
- initializer class for already default-filled structs.

ex:
vks::initializers::descriptorPoolSize(VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER, 1),
vks::initializers::descriptorPoolSize(VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC, 1),
vks::initializers::descriptorPoolSize(VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_COMBINED_IMAGE_SAMPLER, 1)


- separate build_command_buffer ->(cmd begin, pass begin, ..., pass end, cmd end)
  from     draw -> submit and present.
  build_command_buffer can then be called in //
